## Description

My reasoning behind making My First Angular App is to learn a new framework and language (Angular and TypeScript). This app is purely for learning purposes.

## Tech Stack

This project was built with the following technologies:
- **Angular**: The framework used to build the frontend of this app.
- **TypeScript**: The programming language used to develop the app.
- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or above)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (To install Angular CLI, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juanHunOfficial/first-angular-app.git


2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd first-ng-app

3. Install dependencies: 

   ```bash
   npm install

### Running the App

To run the application locally, use the Angular CLI's serve command:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:4200 to view the application.
