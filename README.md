## Purpose

The purpose of "My First Angular App" is to build a foundation in Angular and TypeScript by creating a functional web application. Through this project, I aimed to enhance my understanding of front-end development, learn a component-based framework, and annotate my thoughts in the margin of my code to 
give viewers an idea of my thought processes when learning new technologies. The app serves as a hands-on learning tool to solidify core concepts and practices within Angular development and front-end development as a whole.

## Tech Stack

This project was built with the following technologies:
- **Angular**: The framework used to build the frontend of this app.
- **TypeScript**: The programming language used to develop the app.
- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.
